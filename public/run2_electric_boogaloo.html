    <h2>You run...</h2> 
    <p>You grab the princess's hand and run. You both bolt back to the trail you came from.
      Behind you, you hear the Wendigo reach the edge of the pit. It screeches angrily as it realizes theres no one there.
      Theres more scrambling behind you as you drag the princess back the way you came, first over the bridge, right, left and away from the woods.
    </p>
    <p>As you run you can hear skittering all around you as creatures chase you, trying to stop you from leaving, but before you even know it your gone.</p>
    <p>You slow down to walking as you get further from the woods. You can hear angry howling and screaching and screams from the forest behind you but no one emerges.
      Youre safe now.
    </p>
    <p>You win!</p>
