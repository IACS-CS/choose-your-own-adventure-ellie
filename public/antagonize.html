    <h2>You choose to antagonize the creature...</h2> 
    <p>You decided to pick a fight with them. They stand in the way of the path, what if the princess is behind them? 
      </p>
      <p>You walk up to the creature, planning on a fight, throwing out threats if they dont move and leave you alone. 
      The creature watches as you get closer and then in one swift movement, lunges down onto you, screeching.
    </p>
    <p>you die.</p>
