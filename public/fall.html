    <h2>You jump in...</h2> 
    <p>You slide quickly down the side of the pit and help the princess stand, you hoist her up and send her out of the pit.
      She screams and runs away in hysterics, leaving you behind. You hear screeching and the tearing of feet as the Wendigo appears at the top of the pit.
It leaps into the pit on top of you and lunges, jaw open and teeth bared at you, a hungry look in its glowing eyes.
    </p>
      <p>you died.</p>
      <p>But died successful.</p>
