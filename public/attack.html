    <h2>You choose to attack...</h2> 
    <p>You run at the massive creature yelling, trying to get its attention. It hardly looks at you as it starts moving towards the pit.</p>
      <p>You get to the monster and grab one of its thin legs, its skin is like slimey sandpaper, cold and almost lifeless under your hands.
      The Wendigo snaps its head around to glare at you, eyes glowing an eerie green, its face exposed bone, the skin as though it had been ripped away from its face.
      It screeches and snarles and lunges at you.
    </p>
      <p>you died.</p>
      <p>What did you expect to happen?</p>
