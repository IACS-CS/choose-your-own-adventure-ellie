    <h2>You start heading your way down the trail...</h2> 
    <p>The woods are misty and dark. The trail winds around creeping trees that bend down towards you like theyre trying to grab at you. 
      You come across a fork in the trail, you can go left or right.</p>
      <p>From the left you can hear wind whistling and blowing through the trees. 
        From the right is the ominous sound of an owl in the distance and you can hear rustling in the bushes.</p>
