    <h2>You look for a branch...</h2> 
    <p>You look around wildly and spot a large branch that had fallen from a tree. You run over and grab the branch, pushing it down the side of the slippery pit, telling the princess to grab on.
She scrambles up the branch and out of the pit.
    </p>
    <p>Now what do you do?</p>
