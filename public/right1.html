    <h2>You turn right...</h2> 
    <p>You continue down the trail to the right, hoping that its the right way. God, you wish someone had given you a map.</p>
    <p>You follow the sound of the owl, almost drawing you down the end of the path. The rustling in the bushes on either side of you sets you a bit on edge but you ignore it and continue.</p>
    <p>You come to another fork in the path. To the left theres a bridge leading over a narrow river that bubble and trickles over rocks. 
      To the right, you can hear the owl by the start of the path but the fog is so thick you cant see much more of the trail.
      </p>
      <p>What do you do?</p>
