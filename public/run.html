    <h2>You run...</h2> 
    <p>You run as fast as you can at the pit, your only goal to get there before the Wendigo. You hear rustling and scrambling from the Wendigo as you run but you dont look back.</p>
      <p>You somehow get to the edge of the pit first and look down. At the bottom of a shallow muddy hole is a beautiful brunette woman covered head to toe in mud, wearing a long blue dress and sparkly crown.
        She is crying into her hands but as you arrive making a commotion, she looks up at you and looks relieved, begging you for help.
      </p>
      <p>You quickly look around for anything to help get her out before the Wendigo can get there.</p>
    <p>What do you do?</p>
