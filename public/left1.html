    <h2>You turn left...</h2> 
    <p>You continue down the trail to the left, hoping that its the right way. God, you wish someone had given you a map.</p>
    <p>The wind in this part of the trail is strong and nips at the side of your face and leaves swirl around your ankles.
    </p>
    <p>Up ahead you see the shadow of a person. Theyre tall and looming, neck tilted sideways as they study you. You cant quite make out their face.
      The fog distorts exactly what they are but you can tell its a living being, breathing and standing in front of you. 
      What will you do?
