    <h2>You turn right...</h2> 
    <p>You wander down the foggy path, trying your best to see but its all blank. 
      You move slowly, feeling around as you go so you dont walk into any trees.</p>
   <p>Despite you careful movements, as your stepping along, one of your steps doesnt meet ground beneath your feet as you find a massive ravine in front of you.
    You fall face first into the ravine, tumbling down rocks and smashing into everything.
   </p>
   <p>you die.</p>
