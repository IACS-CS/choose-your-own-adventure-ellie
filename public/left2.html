    <h2>You turn left...</h2> 
    <p>You wander over the bridge, looking down at the stream glittering beneath you, you can see small fish flicking around in the water.
    </p>
    <p>You get over the bridge and continue walking along the path on the other side. Its less winding than the first path as it begins to straighten out. 
      As you walk, you notice the fog around you fading out a little bit and you can now see further. </p>
      <p>You come to the end of the path and walk out into a massive clearing. On the far side of the clearing you can see a pit. The sounds of a woman crying echoes softly around the clearing.</p>
      <p>Adjacent to you in the clearing, you see a shadowy figure on all fours with the horns of a moose studying the clearing.</p>
      <p>What do you do?</p>
