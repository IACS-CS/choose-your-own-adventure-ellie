    <h2>You walk slowly...</h2> 
    <p>You walk slowly and quietly towards the pit, trying your best not to alert the Wendigo of where you are.
      You see it bolt on its thin legs faster than should be normal. </p>
      <p>It gets there first and lunges down into the pit snarling. You hear terrifying screams and wails as you can only assume the Wendigo eats the princess.

    </p>
      <p>You failed</p>
